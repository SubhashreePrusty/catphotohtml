          <h2>Here's a time line of Turing's life:</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">1912</span> - Born in Maida Vale, London.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1928</span> - Aged 16, encountered Albert Einstein's work and managed to deduce Einstein's questioning of Newton's laws of motion from a text.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1934</span> - Awarded first-class honours in Mathematics after studying as an undergraduate at King's College, Cambridge.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1936</span> -  Published his paper "On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem" which has been called "easily the most influential math paper in history".</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1938</span> - Obtained his PhD from the Department of Mathematics at Princeton where he also studied cryptology. Then he worked part-time with the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS), the British codebreaking organisation.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1939</span> - was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park , during the Second World War. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma cipher machine used by Nazi Germany, together with a senior GC&CS codebreaker.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1940</span> - Led the section that was responsible for German naval cryptanalysis and devised a number of techniques for speeding the breaking of German ciphers, including improvements to the pre-war Polish "bombe" method, an electromechanical machine that could find settings for the Enigma machine.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1941</span> -  successfully cracked intercepted coded messages that enabled the Allies to defeat the Axis powers in many crucial engagements, including the Battle of the Atlantic.It has been estimated that this work shortened the war in Europe by more than two years and saved over 14 million lives.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1946</span> - After the war, Turing worked at the National Physical Laboratory, where he designed the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE), one of the first designs for a stored-program computer.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1952</span> - was prosecuted for homosexual acts. He accepted hormone treatment with DES, as an alternative to prison.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1954</span> - dies at the age of 42. An inquest determined his death as a suicide, but it has been noted that the known evidence is also consistent with accidental poisoning.</li>
          </ul>
<div id="footer">
<p>After his death, The British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated".Queen Elizabeth II granted a posthumous pardon. Turing appears on the current Bank of England Â£50 note, which was released on 23 June,2021, to coincide with his birthday. A 2019 BBC series, as voted by the audience, named him the greatest person of the 20th century.</p>
